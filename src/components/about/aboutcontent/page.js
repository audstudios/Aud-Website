            <p className='about-content-paragraph'>For the past decade, we’ve worked side by side, as friends and collaborators, partnering with some of the world’s most iconic brands in both digital and real-world spaces. Along the way, we saw opportunities to rethink how production and strategy could work—more agile, more intentional, more dynamic.
So we created aud studios. We are a founder-led creative and production agency shaped by our shared philosophy to lead with nuance and craft, from ideation to production to wrap.
aud, founder-led. For those who want to collaborate directly with the people doing the work.
aud, nimble and sharp. Built for projects that demand speed, precision, and intention.
aud, collaborative and enthusiastic. For those looking for an extension of their in-house team.
We’re not the standard. We’re aud. 
Not sure how we fit into your project? Just ask. We collaborate with people we trust and who inspire us, because we bring that same energy to every project</p>
